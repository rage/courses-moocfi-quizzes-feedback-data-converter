# Feedback data converter

Converts feedback data that has been collected from courses.mooc.fi exercises to an Excel file.

## Usage

1. Download the program from the releases on the right side of this page.
2. Create a new empty folder where you'll place the program. The program, the input files and the output files will be placed in this folder.
3. Run the program once to create the configuration file on the same folder.
  - If you're running Linux, you'll need to allow executing the file as a program. (Right click the file, select Properties, go to Permissions tab and check the "Allow executing file as program" checkbox.)
4. Export exercise tasks and submissions from courses.mooc.fi and place them to a folder called `data`.
5. Run the program. The output file will be placed in a folder called `output`.
